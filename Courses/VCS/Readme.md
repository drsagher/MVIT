# MVC-111 Version Control and Collaboration
Version Control and Collaboration are foundational practices in modern software development, enabling teams to work efficiently, track changes, and maintain the integrity of their projects. Version control systems (VCS), such as [Git](https://git-scm.com/) , allow developers to manage codebases by recording every change made to files, ensuring a complete history of the project is preserved. This not only facilitates error tracking and rollback to previous states but also supports experimentation through branching and merging, where developers can work on features or fixes independently without disrupting the main codebase. Collaboration is greatly enhanced through platforms like [GitHub](https://github.com/) , [GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com/) , and [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/product/) , which integrate version control with tools for issue tracking, code reviews, and continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD). These platforms enable seamless teamwork, allowing multiple contributors to collaborate on a project while maintaining clear communication and accountability. Features like pull requests and code reviews ensure that changes are scrutinized and approved before being merged, improving code quality and reducing errors. Beyond software development, version control is also valuable for managing documents, configurations, and even design assets, making it an essential tool for any collaborative effort. By adopting version control and collaboration best practices, teams can streamline workflows, reduce conflicts, and deliver high-quality results faster and more reliably.
