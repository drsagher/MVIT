# MVC-505 Designing, Implementing, and Testing Secure APIs
The course *Designing, Implementing, and Testing Secure APIs* is a comprehensive guide to building robust, secure, and high-performance APIs from the ground up. It begins with the fundamentals of API design, covering RESTful principles, endpoint structure, and versioning strategies. Participants learn to implement APIs using **Node.js** with **Express.js** or **FastAPI** in Python, focusing on routing, middleware, request validation, and error handling. The course emphasizes **security best practices**, including **authentication** (OAuth2, JWT), **authorization** (role-based access control), **encryption** (HTTPS, data encryption), and protection against common vulnerabilities like SQL injection, XSS, and CSRF. Database integration is covered using **SQL databases** (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL) or **NoSQL databases** (e.g., MongoDB), with a focus on secure data storage and retrieval. The tech stack includes **Node.js/Express.js**, **FastAPI**, **PostgreSQL/MySQL**, **MongoDB**, **JWT**, **OAuth2**, and tools like **Postman** and **Swagger** for API testing and documentation. Advanced topics like **rate limiting**, **caching with Redis**, **logging**, and **monitoring** are also explored. The course concludes with deployment strategies using **Docker** and cloud platforms (e.g., AWS, Azure), ensuring scalability and reliability. By the end, developers will have designed, implemented, and tested secure APIs, equipped with the skills to build and maintain production-ready APIs.
