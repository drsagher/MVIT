# Lesson 01 Introduction to Generative AI and Large Language Models
To get started, focus on designing intuitive interfaces that accept natural language inputs, eliminating the need for specialized programming knowledge. With a simple text prompt, users can harness the capabilities of AI models to generate reports, craft applications, and accomplish a myriad of tasks in mere seconds. To build such an application, employ a robust technical stack comprising frontend frameworks like React, Angular, or Vue.js, backend frameworks like Node.js, Django, or Flask, and AI libraries like TensorFlow, PyTorch, or Keras. Ensure seamless communication between components using APIs and data integration tools like GraphQL, REST, or Apache Kafka. By following this comprehensive guide, you'll be well on your way to developing a cutting-edge Agentic AI app that transforms the way users interact with AI, making it more accessible, intuitive, and powerful than ever before.
