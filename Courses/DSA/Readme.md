# MVC-21 Data Structures and Algorithms
Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) form the backbone of computer science, providing the foundation for solving complex computational problems efficiently. Data structures are specialized formats for organizing, storing, and managing data, enabling optimal access and modification. Common data structures include arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, graphs, hash tables, and heaps, each suited for specific use cases based on their strengths in memory usage, speed, and scalability. Algorithms, on the other hand, are step-by-step procedures or logic designed to perform operations like searching, sorting, optimization, and decision-making. Key algorithms include sorting (e.g., quicksort, mergesort), searching (e.g., binary search), graph traversal (e.g., BFS, DFS), dynamic programming, greedy algorithms, and divide-and-conquer strategies. Mastery of DSA is critical for writing efficient code, reducing time and space complexity, and excelling in technical interviews. Understanding concepts like Big-O notation helps evaluate algorithm performance, while real-world applications range from database indexing and network routing to machine learning and AI. By combining the right data structure with an appropriate algorithm, developers can build scalable, high-performance systems capable of handling large datasets and complex computations effectively.
