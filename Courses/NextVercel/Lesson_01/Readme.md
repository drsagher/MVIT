# Lesson 01 Introduction to Next.js Framework

Next.js is a popular open-source React framework developed by Vercel that simplifies the process of building modern web applications. It provides a robust set of tools and features for building server-rendered, statically generated, or hybrid React applications. With its focus on performance, scalability, and developer experience, Next.js has become one of the most widely adopted frameworks for full-stack React development.

## Introduction to Next.js
Next.js is built on top of React, leveraging its component-based architecture while adding advanced features like server-side rendering (SSR), static site generation (SSG), and API routes. It bridges the gap between frontend and backend development, enabling developers to build universal (isomorphic) applications that are both performant and SEO-friendly.

## Key Advantages of Next.js
- **Server-Side Rendering (SSR)**: Pre-renders pages on the server, improving performance and SEO.
- **Static Site Generation (SSG)**: Generates static HTML files at build time, ideal for content-heavy websites.
- **Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR)**: Updates static pages without rebuilding the entire site.
- **File-Based Routing**: Simplifies routing with a file-based system, eliminating the need for complex configuration.
- **API Routes**: Allows developers to create backend APIs directly within the Next.js project.
- **Built-In CSS Support**: Supports CSS modules, styled-jsx, and modern styling solutions.
- **Image Optimization**: Automatically optimizes images using the <Image> component.
