# MVC-502 Building RESTful APIs with MEAN Stack
The course *Building RESTful APIs with MEAN Stack* is a comprehensive guide to creating robust, scalable, and efficient APIs using the MEAN (MongoDB, Express.js, Angular, Node.js) stack. It begins with an introduction to the MEAN stack architecture, highlighting the roles of each component: **MongoDB** as the NoSQL database, **Express.js** as the backend framework, **Angular** for the frontend, and **Node.js** as the runtime environment. Participants learn to design and implement RESTful APIs using Express.js, covering essential concepts like routing, middleware, request handling, and error management. The course emphasizes **MongoDB integration** for data storage, including schema design, CRUD operations, and query optimization. It also explores **authentication and authorization** using JWT (JSON Web Tokens) and OAuth2, ensuring secure API access. On the frontend, Angular is used to build dynamic, interactive user interfaces that consume the APIs, with a focus on services, HTTP clients, and state management. The tech stack includes **Node.js**, **Express.js**, **MongoDB**, **Angular**, **TypeScript**, **JWT**, and tools like **Postman** for API testing. Advanced topics like **caching with Redis**, **API versioning**, **rate limiting**, and **deployment** using Docker and cloud platforms (e.g., AWS, Heroku) are also covered. By the end of the course, developers will have built a fully functional RESTful API with a frontend application, gaining hands-on experience in full-stack development and best practices for building modern, scalable web applications.
