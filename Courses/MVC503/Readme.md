# MVC-503 MERN Stack APIs From Scratch to Deployment
The course *MERN Stack APIs From Scratch to Deployment* is a complete guide to building modern, scalable, and efficient APIs using the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) stack. It starts with an introduction to the MERN stack architecture, explaining the roles of each component: **MongoDB** as the NoSQL database, **Express.js** as the backend framework, **React** for the frontend, and **Node.js** as the runtime environment. Participants learn to design and implement RESTful APIs using Express.js, covering key concepts like routing, middleware, request handling, and error management. The course dives into **MongoDB integration**, teaching schema design, CRUD operations, and query optimization. It also covers **authentication and authorization** using JWT (JSON Web Tokens) and OAuth2, ensuring secure API access. On the frontend, React is used to build dynamic, interactive user interfaces that consume the APIs, with a focus on hooks, state management (e.g., Redux or Context API), and API consumption using Axios or Fetch. The tech stack includes **Node.js**, **Express.js**, **MongoDB**, **React**, **JavaScript/TypeScript**, **JWT**, and tools like **Postman** for API testing. Advanced topics like **caching with Redis**, **API versioning**, **rate limiting**, and **deployment** using Docker and cloud platforms (e.g., AWS, Vercel, or Heroku) are also covered. By the end of the course, developers will have built a fully functional MERN stack application, gaining hands-on experience in full-stack development and best practices for building and deploying modern web applications.
