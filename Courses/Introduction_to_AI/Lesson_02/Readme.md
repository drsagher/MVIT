# Lesson 02 Perspectives of AI
AI from a Formal and Casual Perspective
From a formal perspective, AI refers to the development of computer systems that can perform tasks that typically require human intelligence, such as learning, reasoning, problem-solving, and decision-making. This involves the use of algorithms, statistical models, and computer programs to enable machines to understand, interpret, and generate human-like language, vision, and behavior.
From a casual perspective, AI is often thought of as "smart machines" that can think and act like humans. This can include virtual assistants like Siri or Alexa, self-driving cars, and personalized recommendation systems. In this view, AI is seen as a tool that can make our lives easier, more convenient, and more enjoyable, by automating routine tasks, providing helpful insights, and enhancing our interactions with technology. Overall, both perspectives highlight the potential of AI to transform the way we live, work, and interact with each other, and demonstrate the need for a multidisciplinary approach to understanding and developing AI systems that are both effective and responsible.

## [Weak and Strong AI](https://ki.thws.de/en/about/strong-vs-weak-ai-a-definition/)
Weak AI, also known as Narrow AI, is designed to perform a specific task, such as facial recognition, language translation, or playing chess. It is trained on a specific dataset and is not capable of general reasoning or decision-making. Weak AI is typically used to automate tasks, provide insights, or assist humans in specific domains.
Strong AI, also known as Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), refers to a hypothetical AI system that possesses the ability to understand, learn, and apply knowledge across a wide range of tasks, similar to human intelligence. Strong AI would be able to reason, solve problems, and make decisions in a general and abstract way, without being limited to a specific domain or task. It would also be able to learn, adapt, and improve itself over time, potentially leading to significant advancements in various fields.

## The key differences between Weak and Strong AI are:
- Narrow vs. General: Weak AI is designed for a specific task, while Strong AI is designed to be general-purpose.
- Task-oriented vs. Cognitive: Weak AI focuses on automating tasks, while Strong AI aims to replicate human-like cognition and intelligence.
- Limited vs. Unlimited: Weak AI has limited capabilities, while Strong AI has the potential to surpass human intelligence in many areas.

## 05. Foundation of AI
The [foundation of Artificial Intelligence (AI)](https://skillfloor.medium.com/the-foundation-of-artificial-intelligence-3f90fb6f1348) is built on several key concepts and technologies, including Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Natural Language Processing, Computer Vision, and Robotics. These fields rely on mathematical and computational disciplines such as Linear Algebra, Calculus, Probability, and Statistics. Additionally, algorithms and data structures play a crucial role in enabling efficient processing and analysis of data. By combining these concepts and technologies, AI systems can learn, reason, and interact with humans, ultimately enabling them to perform tasks that typically require human intelligence.

## 06. Precursor and Birth of AI
The precursor to Artificial Intelligence (AI) dates back to the mid-20th century with computer scientists and mathematicians like Alan Turing, Marvin Minsky, and John McCarthy exploring machine intelligence. Influential milestones include Charles Babbage's Analytical Engine (1837), Ada Lovelace's Notes on the Analytical Engine (1843), and Turing's Turing Machine (1936). The birth of AI is often attributed to the 1956 Dartmouth Summer Research Project on Artificial Intelligence, led by John McCarthy, where the first AI program, Logical Theorist, was developed. Despite facing challenges and funding cuts in the 1970s and 1980s, AI research experienced a resurgence in the 1990s with advances in computing power, data storage, and machine learning algorithms, leading to significant breakthroughs in areas like natural language processing, computer vision, and robotics.
