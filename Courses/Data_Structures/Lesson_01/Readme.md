# Lesson 01 Introduction to Data Structures

Data structures are systematic methods of organizing, managing, and storing data to enable efficient access and modification. They form the backbone of algorithm design, impacting performance and functionality across applications. This introduction explores fundamental data structures: arrays, stacks, queues, priority queues, linked lists, trees, and graphs, highlighting their unique characteristics and real-world applications.

### Arrays
Arrays are linear collections of elements stored in contiguous memory, accessible via indices. They offer constant-time (O(1)) access but fixed size.
Example: Storing daily temperatures as [72, 68, 75, 80] for quick retrieval by day number.

### Stacks
Stacks follow Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) principles, using push (add) and pop (remove) operations.
Example: Browser "back" buttons undo navigation steps in reverse order.

### Queues
Queues adhere to First-In-First-Out (FIFO), with enqueue (add to rear) and dequeue (remove from front).
Example: Printer task scheduling, processing jobs in arrival order.

### Priority Queues
Elements in priority queues are processed by priority (highest first), often implemented via heaps.
Example: Hospital emergency rooms prioritizing critical patients over others.

### Linked Lists
Linked lists consist of nodes (data + pointers), allowing dynamic insertions/deletions. Types include singly, doubly, and circular.
Example: A music playlist where each song points to the next track.

### Trees
Trees represent hierarchical data with a root and child nodes. Binary trees enable efficient searching (O(log n)) when balanced.
Example: File systems organizing directories and subdirectories.

### Graphs
Graphs model networks of interconnected nodes (vertices) and edges, supporting directed/undirected and weighted connections.
Example: Social networks (users as nodes, friendships as edges) or mapping apps (cities linked by roads).

## Data Structures in Web Development

| Data Structure | Description | Applications | Role in Web Development |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Arrays | Collection of elements of the same data type stored in contiguous memory locations | Storing and manipulating collections of data, such as images, videos, or user information | Used in web development for storing and retrieving data, such as user input, form data, or database records |
| Linked Lists | Dynamic collection of elements, where each element points to the next element | Implementing stacks, queues, and trees, and for efficient insertion and deletion of elements | Used in web development for implementing dynamic data structures, such as shopping carts or comment threads |
| Stacks | Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) data structure, where elements are added and removed from the top | Evaluating postfix expressions, parsing syntax, and implementing recursive algorithms | Used in web development for parsing syntax, evaluating expressions, and implementing recursive algorithms |
| Queues | First-In-First-Out (FIFO) data structure, where elements are added to the end and removed from the front | Implementing job scheduling, print queues, and network protocols | Used in web development for implementing job scheduling, handling requests, and managing network protocols |
| Trees | Hierarchical data structure, where each node has a value and zero or more child nodes | Organizing and searching large datasets, such as file systems or databases | Used in web development for organizing and searching large datasets, such as file systems, databases, or XML documents |
| Graphs | Non-linear data structure, where nodes are connected by edges | Modeling relationships between objects, such as social networks or recommendation systems | Used in web development for modeling relationships between objects, such as social networks, recommendation systems, or content networks |
| Hash Tables | Data structure that maps keys to values using a hash function | Implementing caches, dictionaries, and sets, and for efficient lookup and insertion of elements | Used in web development for implementing caches, dictionaries, and sets, and for efficient lookup and insertion of elements, such as user sessions or database records |
| Heaps | Specialized tree-based data structure that satisfies the heap property | Implementing priority queues, sorting algorithms, and graph algorithms | Used in web development for implementing priority queues, sorting algorithms, and graph algorithms, such as scheduling tasks or optimizing network traffic |
| Trie | Prefix tree data structure, where each node is a string | Autocomplete, spell-checking, and validating input data | Used in web development for autocomplete, spell-checking, and validating input data, such as user names or passwords |

## Conclusion
Choosing the right data structure—linear (arrays, stacks, queues) or non-linear (trees, graphs)—depends on the problem’s requirements. Arrays suit indexed access, while stacks and queues manage ordered workflows. Priority queues handle urgency, linked lists offer flexibility, trees enable hierarchy, and graphs map complex relationships. Mastering these structures empowers efficient solutions to computational challenges.
