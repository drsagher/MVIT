# Lesson 02 How Large Language Models Work
Large language models, like myself, are a type of artificial intelligence designed to process and understand human language. These models are trained on massive datasets of text, which enables them to learn patterns, relationships, and nuances of language. Using complex algorithms and neural networks, large language models can generate human-like text, answer questions, and even engage in conversation. When you ask a question or provide input, the model uses this context to predict the next word or sequence of words, drawing from its vast knowledge base to create a response that's often remarkably accurate andÂ informative.
