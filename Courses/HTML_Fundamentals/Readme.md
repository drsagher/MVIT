# HTML Fundamentals

## Lesson 1 Introduction to HTML
HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the foundational language used to create and structure content on the web. Here's a simple breakdown:

### 1. What Does HTML Do?
- Defines Structure: HTML organizes content like text, images, links, and forms into headings, paragraphs, lists, tables, and more.
- Creates Web Pages: Every webpage you visit is built with HTML even if other languages like CSS or JavaScript enhance it.
- Works with Browsers: Browsers (Chrome, Firefox, etc.) read HTML files and render them into the visual/functional pages you see.

### 2. Key Components of HTML
- Elements: Building blocks of HTML, defined by tags e.g. ```<h1>, <p>, <img>```
- Tags: Enclose content to give it meaning. Most have an opening <tag> and closing </tag> tag.
- Attributes: Provide extra info about elements (e.g., src for images, href for links)

```
<h1>This is a Heading</h1>
<p>This is a paragraph.</p>

<img src="image.jpg" alt="A description">
<a href="https://example.com">Visit Example</a>
```

### 3. HTML is NOT a Programming Language
- Markup, Not Logic: It defines what content is (e.g., a heading, button, or form), not how to perform calculations or logic.
- Static by Default: To add interactivity or dynamic behavior, you need languages like JavaScript.

### 4. How HTML Works with Other Technologies
- CSS: Styles HTML elements (colors, layouts, fonts).
- JavaScript: Adds interactivity (animations, form validation, etc.).
- HTML Alone: Creates static pages (content doesn’t change unless edited manually).

### 5. HTML5: The Modern Standard
HTML5 is the latest version, adding features like:
- Semantic tags ```<header>, <nav>, <article>```
- Multimedia support ```<video>, <audio>```
- Form enhancements (date pickers, input validation).

### 6. Why Learn HTML?
- Essential for Web Development: All websites use HTML.
- Easy to Start: Simple syntax, no complex tools needed.
- Foundation for Other Tools: Frameworks (React, Angular) and CMS platforms (WordPress) rely on HTML.

### Example of a Basic HTML Page
```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>My First Page</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Hello, World!</h1>
    <p>Welcome to my website.</p>
    <img src="welcome.jpg" alt="Welcome image">
</body>
</html>
```

### Key Takeaways
- HTML is the skeleton of every webpage.
- It uses tags and attributes to define content structure.
- Combine it with CSS and JavaScript to create modern, interactive websites.

## History of HTML and its role in web development

HTML (HyperText Markup Language) was created in 1991 by Tim Berners-Lee, a British computer scientist, as part of his vision for the World Wide Web at CERN. Initially designed to share scientific documents, HTML provided a simple way to link text and resources across computers using hyperlinks, revolutionizing how information was accessed globally. The first version, HTML 1.0, laid the groundwork with basic tags for headings, paragraphs, and links. By 1995, HTML 2.0 standardized the language, but the late 1990s saw rapid evolution during the "browser wars" (Netscape vs. Internet Explorer), leading to fragmented features like proprietary tags. To restore order, the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) took charge, releasing HTML 4.01 in 1999, which emphasized structure and accessibility. The early 2000s introduced XHTML, a stricter XML-based version, but developers craved flexibility, paving the way for HTML5 in 2014. HTML5 modernized the language with semantic tags ```<header>, <nav>```, native multimedia support ```<video>, <audio>``` and APIs for offline storage and geolocation, aligning it with the demands of dynamic, interactive web apps.


In web development, HTML serves as the structural backbone of every website, defining content hierarchy, embedding media, and enabling navigation. It works seamlessly with CSS (for styling) and JavaScript (for interactivity) to create rich user experiences. HTML’s role expanded with responsive design, ensuring sites adapt to mobile devices, and its semantic elements improved accessibility for screen readers and SEO. Today, HTML remains indispensable—even modern frameworks like React or Angular rely on it to render interfaces. By democratizing content creation and fostering global connectivity, HTML’s evolution mirrors the web’s growth from static pages to immersive platforms, cementing its place as the cornerstone of the digital age.

## How HTML works with CSS and JavaScript
HTML, CSS, and JavaScript work together to create functional, visually appealing, and interactive websites. HTML forms the structural foundation, defining elements like headings, paragraphs, images, and forms. It organizes content but lacks styling or dynamic behavior. CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) enhances HTML by adding visual design—controlling layouts, colors, fonts, and responsiveness. By targeting HTML elements via selectors, CSS transforms raw content into polished interfaces. JavaScript introduces interactivity, manipulating HTML and CSS in real-time. It responds to user actions (clicks, scrolls, form inputs), fetches data dynamically, and updates the DOM (Document Object Model), allowing pages to react without reloading. For example, HTML creates a button, CSS styles it, and JavaScript triggers an action when clicked. Together, they form a layered approach: HTML for content, CSS for presentation, and JavaScript for behavior, enabling modern, dynamic web experiences.

## Understanding browsers and rendering engines
Understanding browsers and rendering engines is key to grasping how web content becomes visible. Browsers like Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge rely on rendering engines (e.g., Blink, Gecko, WebKit) to interpret HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, converting code into visual and interactive pages. The engine parses HTML to build the DOM (Document Object Model), processes CSS to create the CSSOM (CSS Object Model), and combines them into a render tree that calculates layout and paints pixels on the screen. Each engine handles rendering differently, which can lead to subtle cross-browser inconsistencies in how designs or features appear. Developers use browser developer tools (like Chrome DevTools) to inspect and debug this process, optimizing performance and ensuring compatibility. By understanding how engines prioritize tasks (like layout calculations or repaints), developers can write efficient code that speeds up page loads and enhances user experience. This knowledge bridges the gap between code and what users see, ensuring websites work seamlessly across devices and platforms.

## Lesson 2 Basic HTML Document Structure
An HTML document follows a standardized hierarchy of tags to ensure browsers render content correctly. Here’s what it looks like:

```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Document Title</title>
</head>
<body>
    <!-- Visible content goes here -->
    <h1>Hello, World!</h1>
    <p>This is a paragraph.</p>
</body>
</html>
```

### ``` <!DOCTYPE html> ```
- Declares the document type and HTML version (HTML5 in this case).
- Ensures the browser renders the page in standards mode.

### ``` <html> ```
- The root element wrapping all content.
- The ``` lang ``` attribute specifies the document’s language (e.g., ``` en ``` for English).

### ``` <head> ```
- Contains metadata (data about the page) not visible to users.
- Includes:
  - ``` <meta charset="UTF-8"> ``` : Sets character encoding (supports all symbols/emojis).
  - ``` <meta name="viewport"> ``` : Ensures responsive design on mobile devices.
  - ``` <title> ```: Defines the page title shown in browser tabs/bookmarks.
  - Links to CSS files, scripts, or icons.

### ``` <body> ``
- Holds visible content displayed to users: text, images, links, forms, etc.
- Common elements: headings ``` <h1> to <h6> ```, paragraphs ``` <p> ```, lists, images ``` <img> ```, and semantic tags like ``` <header>, <main>, <footer> ```.

### Key Notes
- Indentation: Proper indentation improves readability (not required but recommended).
- Semantic Tags: Modern HTML uses tags like ``` <header>, <nav> ```, and ``` <article> ``` for better accessibility and SEO.
- External Files: CSS and JavaScript are often linked in the <head> or at the end of ``` <body> ```.

### Why This Structure Matters
- Browsers use this structure to parse and render content accurately.
- Missing tags e.g., ``` <head> or <body> ``` can cause rendering issues.
- A well-structured document is essential for SEO, accessibility, and future code maintenance.

### HTML Comments
In HTML, comments are notes added to the code that are ignored by browsers and not displayed on the webpage. They help developers explain code, leave reminders, or temporarily disable parts of the HTML without deleting them.

## Lesson 3 HTML Elements and Tags
HTML Elements and Tags are the building blocks of a web page, used to define the structure and content of a document. HTML Elements represent a component or a section of a web page, such as a heading, paragraph, image, or link, while Tags are the markup symbols used to define the start and end of an element. HTML Tags are surrounded by angle brackets and usually come in pairs, with the opening tag preceding the content and the closing tag following it, allowing web browsers to interpret and render the content correctly.

### Basic HTML Tags

## Lesson 4 Working with Links
In HTML, URLs (Uniform Resource Locators) are used to link to resources like web pages, images, scripts, or stylesheets. These URLs can be structured as absolute or relative, each serving different purposes and use cases. Below is a breakdown of their differences, syntax, and best practices.
### Absolute vs. relative URLs
#### 1. Absolute URLs
An absolute URL specifies the complete path to a resource, including the protocol (e.g., https://), domain name, and full directory structure. It provides an exact location, independent of the current page’s location.

Syntax:
```protocol://domain/path/to/resource```
Example:
```
<a href="https://www.example.com/blog/post.html">Read Post</a>
<img src="https://www.example.com/images/logo.png">
```

Key Features:
- Self-contained: Works from any location (even outside the website).
- External links: Required when linking to resources on a different domain.
- Explicit: No ambiguity in resolving the resource’s location.

Pros:
- Guaranteed to work regardless of the current page’s URL.
- Essential for cross-domain resources (e.g., loading a CDN-hosted library).

Cons:
- Longer and harder to read/maintain.
- Less portable: Requires updating all links if the domain changes.

#### 2. Relative URLs
A relative URL specifies a path relative to the current page’s location. It omits the protocol and domain, relying on the browser to resolve the full path based on the current page’s URL.

Syntax Types:
- Same Directory:```<a href="contact.html">Contact</a>  <!-- Looks in the current folder -->```
- Subdirectory: ```<img src="images/photo.jpg">       <!-- Looks in the "images" subfolder -->```
- Parent Directory:```<a href="../index.html">Home</a>   <!-- "../" moves up one directory -->```
- Root-Relative (starts with /):```<link href="/styles/main.css">     <!-- Starts from the domain root -->```

Key Features:
- Portable: Works even if the domain changes (e.g., moving from dev to production).
- Shorter: Cleaner code and easier maintenance for internal links.
- Context-dependent: Paths are resolved relative to the current page’s URL.

Pros:
- Simplifies site structure updates (e.g., reorganizing directories).
- Reduces redundancy in code.

Cons:
- May break if files are moved without updating relative paths.
- Not suitable for external resources.

#### 3. When to Use Each
When deciding between absolute and relative URLs in HTML, it's essential to consider the context and purpose of the link. Absolute URLs, which include the full domain name and path (e.g., ```https://www.example.com/path/to/resource```, should be used when linking to external websites, resources that may be accessed directly, or when migrating content to a new domain. On the other hand, relative URLs, which specify the path relative to the current document (e.g., ```/path/to/resource or ../path/to/resource```), are suitable for internal linking within a website, as they simplify maintenance, reduce the risk of broken links, and improve page loading times. By choosing the right type of URL, developers can ensure their website's architecture is robust, scalable, and user-friendly.

#### 4. The ```<base>``` Tag: Overriding Relative URL Context
The HTML ```<base>``` tag in the ```<head>``` section defines a default base URL for relative links on a page. For example:```<base href="https://www.example.com/blog/">```
All relative URLs (e.g., post.html) will resolve to https://www.example.com/blog/post.html. Use with caution, as it affects all links on the page.

#### 5. Best Practices
- Use relative URLs for internal resources to improve maintainability.
- Use absolute URLs for external resources or when sharing links outside your site.
- Test relative paths thoroughly to avoid broken links after restructuring files.
- For root-relative paths (/path), ensure your site is hosted at the domain root.

By understanding the differences between absolute and relative URLs, you can create more flexible, maintainable, and efficient HTML structures. Choose the right type based on context to ensure seamless navigation and resource loading.

### Linking to external pages, internal sections (anchor links), emails (mailto:), and files (PDFs, etc.)

#### 1. Linking to External Pages
Use absolute URLs to link to pages outside your website.

Syntax:```<a href="https://www.example.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Visit Example</a>```

```target="_blank": Opens the link in a new tab/window.```

```rel="noopener noreferrer```: Security best practice for external links to prevent security vulnerabilities.

Example:```<a href="https://www.google.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Go to Google</a>```

#### 2. Linking to Internal Sections (Anchor Links)
Link to specific sections within the same page or another page using ```#id```.

Syntax:
```
<!-- Define the target section with an `id` -->
<h2 id="section1">Section 1</h2>

<!-- Link to the section -->
<a href="#section1">Jump to Section 1</a>

<!-- Link to a section on another page -->
<a href="about.html#contact">Contact Us</a>
```

Example:
```
<!-- On index.html -->
<a href="#top">Back to Top</a>

<!-- On about.html -->
<a href="index.html#services">View Services</a>
```

#### 3. Linking to Emails (```mailto:```)
Open the user’s email client with a pre-filled email.

Syntax:
```
<a href="mailto:email@example.com?subject=Hello&body=Hi%20there">Send Email</a>
```

Add ```subject```, ```body```, ```cc```, or ```bcc``` parameters.

Use ```%20``` for spaces or URL-encode special characters.

Example:
```
<a href="mailto:contact@example.com?cc=team@example.com&subject=Inquiry&body=Hello%2C%0AHow%20are%20you%3F">Contact Us</a>
```

#### 4. Linking to Files (PDFs, ZIPs, etc.)
Link to downloadable files using relative or absolute paths.

Syntax:
```
<a href="/downloads/file.pdf" download>Download PDF</a>
<a href="/files/report.docx">View Report</a>
```

```download```: Forces the browser to download the file (works for same-origin URLs).
Omit ```download``` to let the browser preview the file (e.g., PDFs in a new tab).

Example:
```
<!-- Relative path -->
<a href="docs/user-guide.pdf">User Guide (PDF)</a>

<!-- Absolute path -->
<a href="https://example.com/files/data.zip" download>Download Dataset</a>
```

#### Best Practices

##### External Links:
- Always include rel="noopener" or rel="noreferrer" for security.
- Use descriptive anchor text (avoid "click here").

##### Anchor Links:
- Ensure the target id exists on the page.
- Test cross-page anchors (e.g., about.html#team).

##### Email Links:
- Warn users that clicking will open their email client.
- Avoid spammy use of mailto: links.

##### File Links:
- Specify the file type in the link text (e.g., "Download PDF").
- Host large files on a CDN for faster downloads.

##### Accessibility Tips
- Use meaningful link text (e.g., "Read our privacy policy" instead of "Click here").
- For anchor links, provide visual feedback (e.g., CSS highlighting when the section is active).

```
<!-- External Page -->
<a href="https://twitter.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Follow us on Twitter</a>

<!-- Anchor Link -->
<a href="#features">View Features</a>
<section id="features">...</section>

<!-- Email Link -->
<a href="mailto:support@example.com">Email Support</a>

<!-- File Download -->
<a href="/downloads/brochure.pdf" download>Download Brochure (PDF)</a>
```

By using these techniques, you can create intuitive, user-friendly navigation for websites, emails, and file downloads.

### HTML Target Attributes: ```_blank``` vs. ```_self``` Explained
The HTML ```target``` attribute defines where a hyperlink (or form submission) will open. The two most common values are ```_blank``` and ```_self```, each serving distinct purposes. Let’s break down their differences, use cases, and best practices.

#### 1. target="_self" (Default Behavior)
- What it does: Opens the linked resource in the same browsing context (e.g., the same tab or window). This is the default behavior if no target attribute is specified.
- Syntax: ```<a href="page.html" target="_self">Link</a>
<!-- Equivalent to omitting the target attribute -->
<a href="page.html">Link</a> ```

Use Cases:
- Navigating within the same website (e.g., internal menu links).
- When you want to keep the user in the current tab/window.

Pros:
- Avoids cluttering the browser with multiple tabs.
- Seamless for internal navigation.

#### 2. ```target="_blank"```
What it does: Opens the linked resource in a new tab or window, depending on browser settings.
Syntax:```<a href="https://external-site.com" target="_blank">External Link</a>```

Use Cases:
- Linking to external websites (e.g., social media, partner sites).
- Opening non-HTML files (e.g., PDFs) for download/preview.
- Keeping users on your site while providing external references.

Security Best Practice:
Always add ```rel="noopener"``` or ```rel="noreferrer"``` to prevent security risks like reverse tabnabbing:```<a href="https://external-site.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Safe Link</a>```

Pros:
- Preserves the user’s current session on your site.
- Useful for external resources or documents.

Cons:
- Overuse can annoy users with too many tabs.
- Accessibility issue: Screen readers might not notify users the link opens a new tab.

#### 3. Best Practices
Use ```_self``` by default for internal navigation to avoid overwhelming users with tabs.

Use ```_blank``` sparingly:
- Reserve it for external links or non-HTML files (e.g., ```href="file.pdf```").
- Always include ```rel="noopener noreferrer``` for security.
- Warn users if a link opens in a new tab (e.g., “(opens in new tab)” in the link text).
- Avoid using ```_blank``` for critical actions (e.g., checkout processes).

#### 4. Examples
- Internal Link (Same Tab):```<a href="/about.html">About Us</a> <!-- Defaults to _self -->```
- External Link (New Tab):```<a href="https://twitter.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Follow Us (opens in new tab)</a>```
- PDF Download:```<a href="/docs/manual.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Download Manual (PDF)</a>```

#### 5. HTML `target` Attributes Comparison

| Attribute       | Behavior                                                                 | Use Case                                                                 | Security Considerations                                                                 |
|-----------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `_self`         | Opens the link in the **same tab/window** (default behavior).            | Internal navigation (e.g., `about.html`, `#section1`).                  | No risk. Safe for same-origin links.                                                    |
| `_blank`        | Opens the link in a **new tab/window**.                                  | External links (e.g., social media, partner sites) or file downloads.    | Use `rel="noopener noreferrer"` to prevent reverse tabnabbing attacks.                  |
| `_parent`       | Opens the link in the **parent frame** (used in nested frames/iframes). | Legacy frameset navigation (rarely used in modern web development).      | Depends on parent context; ensure trustworthiness.                                      |
| `_top`          | Opens the link in the **full window**, breaking out of all frames.       | Escaping embedded frames/iframes (e.g., breaking out of a nested UI).    | Use when untrusted content is embedded in frames.                                       |
| `[custom name]` | Opens the link in a **named window/frame** (e.g., `target="myFrame"`).   | Controlling where content loads in a multi-frame environment.            | Avoid reusing names for untrusted content; potential phishing risks.                   |

#### 6. Key Notes:
- **Default**: `target="_self"` is implied if omitted.
- **Security**: Always use `rel="noopener noreferrer"` with `target="_blank"` for external links.
- **Accessibility**: Indicate when links open in new tabs (e.g., `(opens in new tab)` in anchor text).

#### 7. Other Target Attributes
While _blank and _self are most common, HTML supports additional values:
- ```_parent```: Opens in the parent frame (used in framesets).
- ```_top```: Opens in the full body of the window (escaping frames).
- Named targets: Open in a specific named window/frame (e.g., ```target="myWindow"```).
