# Lesson 08 HTML5 Features
HTML5 is the latest version of the Hypertext Markup Language, offering a range of exciting features that enhance the web development experience. 
Some of the key features of HTML5 include native support for audio and video playback, improved semantics and structure through new elements like ```<header>```, ```<nav>```, and ```<footer>```, 
and enhanced offline capabilities through the Application Cache API and local storage. Additionally, HTML5 introduces web sockets for real-time communication, geolocation API for location-based services, 
and web workers for background processing. With its improved performance, security, and accessibility features, HTML5 enables developers to create faster, more engaging, and more interactive web applications 
that provide a richer user experience.

## Semantics and Structure
1. New Semantic Elements: HTML5 introduces new semantic elements like ```<header>```, ```<nav>```, ```<main>```, ```<section>```, ```<article>```, ```<aside>```, ```<footer>```, and more.
