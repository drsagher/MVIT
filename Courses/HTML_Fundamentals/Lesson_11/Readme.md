# Lesson 11 HTML Symbols, Emojis and Character Entities
HTML symbols, emojis, and character entities are used to represent special characters and glyphs in web pages. These characters can be used to add visual interest, convey emotions, and provide additional meaning to text. HTML symbols and character entities are represented using a combination of ampersands, hash symbols, and semicolons, such as &copy; for the copyright symbol and &#x1F600; for a grinning face emoji. Emojis, on the other hand, are represented using Unicode characters, which can be copied and pasted directly into HTML code. With the increasing use of emojis in digital communication, HTML5 has introduced new ways to include emojis in web pages, making it easier to add tone and personality to online content.

## HTML Symbols
HTML symbols are special characters that can be used in HTML documents to represent a wide range of symbols, such as mathematical operators, currency symbols, and emojis. These symbols are represented using a combination of ampersands, hash symbols, and semicolons.

## Types of HTML Symbols
There are several types of HTML symbols, including:
1. Character Entities: These are symbols that are represented using a combination of ampersands, hash symbols, and semicolons. For example, &copy; represents the copyright symbol.
2. Numerical Character References: These are symbols that are represented using a numerical code. For example, &#169; represents the copyright symbol.
3. Unicode Characters: These are symbols that are represented using Unicode code points. For example, &#x1F600; represents a grinning face emoji.

### Common HTML Symbols
Here are some common HTML symbols:
1. Mathematical Operators:
    - &plus; (+)
    - &minus; (-)
    - &times; (×)
    - &divide; (÷)
2. Currency Symbols:
    - &cent; (¢)
    - &euro; (€)
    - &pound; (£)
    - &yen; (¥)
3. Emojis:
    - &#x1F600; (grinning face)
    - &#x1F601; (grinning face with smiling eyes)
    - &#x1F602; (face with tears of joy)
4. Other Symbols:
    - &copy; (copyright symbol)
    - &reg; (registered trademark symbol)
    - &trade; (trademark symbol)

### Using HTML Symbols

To use HTML symbols in your web page, simply copy and paste the symbol code into your HTML document. For example:

<p>The copyright symbol is &copy;.</p>

This will display the copyright symbol on your web page.

### Best Practices

Here are some best practices to keep in mind when using HTML symbols:

1. Use the correct symbol code: Make sure to use the correct symbol code for the symbol you want to display.
2. Test your symbols: Test your symbols in different browsers and devices to ensure they display correctly.
3. Use symbols sparingly: Use symbols sparingly and only when necessary to avoid cluttering your web page.

## HTML Emojis
HTML emojis are a way to add visual interest and personality to web pages using small digital images or icons. Emojis can be used to convey emotions, illustrate concepts, and add tone to text. In HTML, emojis can be represented using Unicode characters, which can be copied and pasted directly into HTML code. For example, the smiling face emoji 🙂 can be represented using the Unicode character &#x1F600;. Emojis can also be used in combination with text to create more expressive and engaging content. With the increasing use of emojis in digital communication, HTML emojis have become a popular way to add visual flair and personality to web pages.
