# Lesson 11 HTML Symbols, Emojis and Character Entities
HTML symbols, emojis, and character entities are used to represent special characters and glyphs in web pages. These characters can be used to add visual interest, convey emotions, and provide additional meaning to text. HTML symbols and character entities are represented using a combination of ampersands, hash symbols, and semicolons, such as &copy; for the copyright symbol and &#x1F600; for a grinning face emoji. Emojis, on the other hand, are represented using Unicode characters, which can be copied and pasted directly into HTML code. With the increasing use of emojis in digital communication, HTML5 has introduced new ways to include emojis in web pages, making it easier to add tone and personality to online content.
