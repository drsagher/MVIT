# Lesson 06 HTML Table
HTML tables are a fundamental element in web development, used to display and organize data in a structured and visually appealing way. A table consists of rows and columns, with each intersection of a row and column forming a cell. HTML tables are defined using the <table> element, with each row represented by a <tr> element and each cell represented by a <td> element. Tables can also include headers, footers, and captions, and can be styled using CSS to control their appearance, layout, and behavior. HTML tables are commonly used to display tabular data, such as schedules, statistics, and product information, and are an essential tool for creating accessible and user-friendly web pages. With the use of semantic HTML and CSS, tables can be made responsive, interactive, and visually appealing, making them a powerful tool for web developers.
