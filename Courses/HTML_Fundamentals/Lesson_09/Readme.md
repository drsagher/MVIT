# Lesson 09 Meta Tags and SEO Basics
Meta tags and SEO basics are essential components of search engine optimization, helping websites rank higher in search engine results pages (SERPs). Meta tags, such as title tags, meta descriptions, and keyword tags, provide crucial information about a web page's content to search engines. Meanwhile, SEO basics involve optimizing website elements like header tags, content, images, and internal linking to improve crawlability, indexability, and user experience. Additionally, technical optimization techniques like page speed optimization, mobile-friendliness, and SSL encryption also play a vital role in enhancing website visibility and ranking. By mastering meta tags and SEO basics, website owners can improve their online presence, drive more traffic, and increase conversions.

## Meta Tags
Meta tags are HTML tags that provide information about a web page to search engines and other web crawlers. They are placed in the <head> section of an HTML document.

## Types of Meta Tags
1. Title Tag: The title tag is one of the most important meta tags. It specifies the title of the page, which is displayed in the search engine results pages (SERPs) and in the browser's title bar.
```
<title>Page Title</title>
```
2. Meta Description Tag: The meta description tag provides a brief summary of the page's content. It is often displayed in the SERPs below the page title.
```
<meta name="description" content="Page summary">
```

3. Meta Keywords Tag: The meta keywords tag specifies the keywords related to the page's content. However, this tag is no longer considered important by most search engines.
```
<meta name="keywords" content="keyword1, keyword2, keyword3">
```

4. Robots Meta Tag: The robots meta tag instructs search engine crawlers on how to crawl and index the page.
```
<meta name="robots" content="index, follow">
```

5. Viewport Meta Tag: The viewport meta tag controls the zooming and scaling of web pages on mobile devices.
```
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
```
