# Lesson 01 AutoGen Installation

There are two ways to install AutoGen Studio - from PyPi or from source. We recommend installing from PyPi unless you plan to modify the source code.

## Install from PyPi (Recommended)

You can install AutoGen Studio using pip, the Python package manager.

```
pip install -U autogenstudio
```

## Running the Application
Once installed, run the web UI by entering the following in your terminal:

```
autogenstudio ui --port 8081
```
