# MVC-501 Building Real-Time APIs with FastAPI
Building Real-Time APIs with FastAPI is a comprehensive course designed to teach developers how to create high-performance, scalable, and real-time APIs using the FastAPI framework. The course covers the entire development lifecycle, starting with an introduction to FastAPI's features, such as its **async/await support**, **automatic API documentation** (via Swagger and ReDoc), and **type safety** with Pydantic. Participants learn to design RESTful and WebSocket APIs for real-time communication, integrating technologies like **WebSockets** for bidirectional data flow and **WebRTC** for peer-to-peer communication. The course also dives into advanced topics such as **authentication and authorization** using OAuth2 and JWT, **database integration** with SQL databases (e.g., PostgreSQL) via ORMs like SQLAlchemy or NoSQL databases like MongoDB. Additionally, it covers **caching** with Redis, **message brokers** like RabbitMQ or Kafka for event-driven architectures, and **containerization** with Docker for deployment. The tech stack includes **Python**, **FastAPI**, **Uvicorn** (ASGI server), **PostgreSQL/MongoDB**, **Redis**, **Docker**, and **Kubernetes** for orchestration. By the end of the course, developers will have built a fully functional real-time API, deployed it using cloud platforms like AWS or Heroku, and learned best practices for performance optimization, security, and scalability. This course equips developers with the skills to build modern, real-time APIs for applications like chat systems, live notifications, and collaborative tools.
