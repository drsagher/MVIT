# Lesson 2 Start Thinking in Python

In this lesson, we'll cover the fundamentals of Python, starting with an exploration of various data types, including integers, real numbers, and strings. As you progress through the lesson, you'll discover how to use expressions in mathematical operations, store values in variables, and explore multiple techniques for manipulating strings.

## Learning Objectives:
- Demonstrate an understanding of types in Python by converting or casting data types such as strings, floats, and integers.
- Interpret variables and solve expressions by applying mathematical operations.
- Describe how to manipulate strings by using a variety of methods and operations.
- Build a program in JupyterLab to demonstrate your knowledge of types, expressions, and variables.
- Work with, manipulate, and perform operations on strings in Python.
