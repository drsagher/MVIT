# Micro Learning Modules
Micro Learning Modules are bite-sized, self-contained learning units that focus on a specific skill or knowledge area, designed to be consumed in a short period of time. These modules are tailored to meet the needs of modern learners, who are often overwhelmed by information and have limited time to dedicate to learning. Micro Learning Modules are usually interactive, engaging, and multimedia-rich, incorporating elements such as videos, animations, gamification, quizzes, and simulations to enhance the learning experience. They can be easily accessed on-demand, via mobile devices, desktops, or Learning Management Systems (LMS), allowing learners to fit learning into their busy schedules. By providing just-in-time learning, Micro Learning Modules enable learners to quickly acquire new skills, refresh their knowledge, or address specific performance gaps, ultimately leading to improved job performance, increased productivity, and enhanced career development. Moreover, Micro Learning Modules offer organizations a flexible and cost-effective way to deliver training, as they can be easily updated, modified, or expanded to meet changing business needs.

## Deficiency semester
The deficiency semester is designed to bridge the gap in foundational knowledge for students pursuing a Fullstack AI Engineer program. This semester focuses on two crucial subjects: Introduction to World Wide Web Technologies and Introduction to Artificial Intelligence. In the World Wide Web Technologies course, students will learn the fundamentals of web development, including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and web frameworks, enabling them to build dynamic and interactive web applications. In the Artificial Intelligence course, students will explore the basics of AI, including machine learning, natural language processing, and computer vision, providing a solid foundation for advanced AI topics in subsequent semesters. By completing these courses, students will gain a comprehensive understanding of both web development and AI principles, preparing them for success in the Fullstack AI Engineer program.
