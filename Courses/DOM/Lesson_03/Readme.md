# Lesson 03 Document Properties
The HTML document properties provide valuable information about the current HTML document being manipulated by JavaScript. These properties allow developers to access and modify various attributes of the document, such as its title, URL, referrer, and character set. For example, 
the ```document.title``` property returns the title of the current HTML document, while the ```document.URL``` property returns the URL of the current document. Additionally, properties like ```document.referrer``` and
