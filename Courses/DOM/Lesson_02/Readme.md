# Lesson 02 DOM Fundamentals
The Document Object Model (DOM) is a programming interface for HTML and XML documents. It represents the structure of a document as a tree of nodes, where each node corresponds to an element, attribute, or piece of text. The DOM allows developers to interact with and manipulate the document's content, layout, and behavior. It provides a way to access and modify elements, attributes, and text nodes, as well as to respond to events such as clicks, keyboard input, and page loads. Understanding the DOM is essential for building dynamic web applications, as it allows developers to create, modify, and control the behavior of web pages. The DOM is composed of several key components, including elements, attributes, text nodes, and events, which work together to provide a powerful and flexible way to interact with web documents.
