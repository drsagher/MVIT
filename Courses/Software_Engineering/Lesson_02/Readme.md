# Lesson 02 Comprehensive Study of Software Development Models
Software development models provide structured approaches to project management, guiding teams from conception to deployment. Each model offers unique processes, advantages, and challenges. Below is an analysis of key models, their characteristics, and use cases.

# Software Development Models
## Waterfall Model
## Agile Model
## Iterative Model
## Spiral Model
## V-Model (Verification & Validation)
## Rapid Application Development (RAD)
## DevOps
## Lean Model
## Feature-Driven Development (FDD)

# Comparative Analysis

# Choosing the Right Model
- Project Requirements: Stable (Waterfall) vs. dynamic (Agile).
- Team Size: Small (Scrum/Kanban) vs. large (FDD).
- Risk Tolerance: High-risk (Spiral) vs. low-risk (V-Model).
- Timeline: Tight deadlines (RAD) vs. long-term (Iterative).

# Conclusion
No single model fits all projects. Hybrid approaches (e.g., Water-Scrum-Fall) are increasingly popular. Future trends include AI-driven automation and emphasis on DevOps practices. Align the model with project goals, team dynamics, and stakeholder needs for optimal outcomes.
