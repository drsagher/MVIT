# MVC-120 [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/)
[Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) is a widely-used, open-source front-end framework designed to simplify and accelerate the process of building responsive, mobile-first websites and web applications. Developed by Twitter, Bootstrap provides a comprehensive collection of CSS and JavaScript components, such as grids, navigation bars, buttons, modals, carousels, and forms, that are pre-styled and customizable, enabling developers to create visually appealing and consistent designs with minimal effort. Its responsive grid system, based on a 12-column layout, ensures seamless adaptability across devices of all sizes, from desktops to smartphones. Bootstrap also supports utility classes for spacing, typography, and alignment, allowing for precise control over layouts without writing custom CSS. Additionally, it integrates with JavaScript plugins like dropdowns, tooltips, and popovers to enhance interactivity. Developers can customize Bootstrap by modifying its SCSS variables or using the built-in customization tools to tailor the framework to specific project needs. With extensive documentation, a large community, and compatibility with modern frameworks like React, Angular, and Vue.js, Bootstrap remains a go-to choice for both beginners and experienced developers aiming to build sleek, functional, and cross-browser-compatible interfaces efficiently.
