# Lesson 04 Display property: ```block```, ```inline```, ```inline-block```
Mastering the CSS display property is essential for building visually appealing and responsive web pages. The display property determines how an element is displayed and laid out on a web page, with three fundamental values: block, inline, and inline-block. Block elements, such as divs and paragraphs, occupy the full width of their parent container and start on a new line. Inline elements, like spans and anchors, sit alongside other elements on the same line. Inline-block elements, meanwhile, combine the characteristics of both, allowing for precise control over layout and design. Understanding the nuances of these display properties is crucial for creating flexible, responsive, and maintainable CSS layouts.
