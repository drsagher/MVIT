# CHAPTER 13 CODE EDITORS

## 13.1 Code Editors

Code editors are software tools that programmers use to write, edit, and manage source code. They provide various features and functionalities to make the coding process easier and more efficient. Some of the key features of code editors include syntax highlighting, code completion, code folding, version control integration, debugging tools, and customization options.

Code editors can be divided into two main categories: text editors and integrated development environments (IDEs). Text editors are simple and lightweight tools that are designed for basic code editing tasks. They usually have fewer features and options than IDEs, but they are faster and more flexible.

IDEs, on the other hand, are more powerful and comprehensive tools that provide a complete development environment for building and testing applications. They typically include advanced features such as project management, debugging, testing, and deployment tools. IDEs are generally preferred for larger projects and teams, while text editors are often used for smaller projects or for coding on-the-go.
