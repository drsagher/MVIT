# LESSON 5 SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT LIFE CYCLE

## 5.1 Evolution of Software Engineering

Software engineering is a field that has undergone significant evolution since its inception in the mid-20th century. Here is a brief overview of some of the key stages in the evolution of software engineering:

### 5.1.1 Early Years

In the 1950s and 1960s, the field of software engineering was still in its infancy, and there were few established best practices for developing software. At this time, computer programs were often created by individual programmers working in isolation, using ad hoc methods and techniques.

### 5.1.2 Structured Programming

In the 1970s, the concept of structured programming emerged, which introduced the idea of using structured modules and functions to create software. This approach emphasized the importance of well-organized, modular code that was easier to read, maintain, and modify.

### 5.1.3 Object-Oriented Programming

In the 1980s, the concept of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) emerged, which introduced the idea of using objects and classes to create software. OOP emphasized the importance of abstraction, encapsulation, and inheritance, which allowed developers to create more flexible, reusable code.

### 5.1.4 Agile Software Development

In the 1990s and 2000s, the concept of agile software development emerged, which emphasized the importance of iterative, collaborative, and adaptive development processes. Agile methodologies focused on delivering working software quickly and efficiently, while also allowing for frequent changes and feedback from users.

### 5.1.5 DevOps and Continuous Delivery

In recent years, the focus has shifted to the concept of DevOps and continuous delivery, which emphasizes the importance of collaboration between developers, operations teams, and other stakeholders in the software development process. DevOps methodologies focus on streamlining and automating the software development process, while also ensuring that software is delivered quickly, reliably, and with high quality.

Overall, the evolution of software engineering has been driven by a desire to create more efficient, flexible, and reliable software, as well as a recognition of the importance of collaboration, communication, and iterative development processes.

## 5.2 Software Development Life Cycle

SDLC (Software Development Life Cycle) is a structured methodology used in software development that outlines the various stages involved in the software development process, from ideation to deployment and maintenance.

The following are the different stages involved in the SDLC:

### 5.2.1 Planning

This stage involves defining the project goals, scope, and requirements, as well as creating a project plan, a budget, and a timeline.

### 5.2.2 Analysis

In this stage, the requirements for the software are analyzed in detail to ensure that they are complete, accurate, and feasible. This may involve meeting with stakeholders, conducting surveys, and researching industry standards.

### 5.2.3 Design

Once the requirements have been analyzed, the design stage begins, where the software architecture, interface design, and database design are planned and documented.

### 5.2.4 Development

This stage involves actually writing the code for the software, which may be done using various programming languages and tools.

### 5.2.5 Testing

In this stage, the software is tested to ensure that it meets the requirements, is free from errors, and is ready for release. Testing may involve unit testing, integration testing, and system testing, among others.

### 5.2.6 Deployment

Once the software has been tested and approved, it is deployed to the production environment, where it can be accessed and used by end-users.

### 5.2.7 Maintenance

This stage involves maintaining the software after it has been deployed, which may include fixing bugs, adding new features, and making upgrades as necessary.

The SDLC methodology provides a structured approach to software development, which helps to ensure that the resulting software is of high quality, is delivered on time and within budget, and meets the needs of the end-users.

## 5.3 Software Development Models

There are several software development models that provide a structured approach to developing software. Each model has its own unique characteristics, advantages, and disadvantages, and can be chosen based on the project requirements, team size, and available resources. The following are some common software development models:

### 5.3.1 Waterfall Model

This is a linear, sequential model where each phase of the development process (requirements, design, implementation, testing, and maintenance) is completed in a predetermined sequence.

### 5.3.2 Agile Model

This is an iterative and incremental model where requirements and solutions evolve through the collaborative effort of self-organizing and cross-functional teams.

### 5.3.3 Spiral Model

This is a risk-driven model that combines the elements of the waterfall model and the prototyping model, where the project is divided into smaller parts and each part goes through the phases of the waterfall model in a circular way.

### 5.3.4 Prototype Model

This is a model where a prototype is created early in the development process to give stakeholders an early look at the system and to identify any potential issues.

### 5.3.5 V-Model

This is a variation of the waterfall model where each phase of the development process is paired with a corresponding testing phase, making it more systematic and structured.

### 5.3.6 Rapid Application Development (RAD) Model

This is a model where the development process is accelerated by using pre-built components and tools.

### 5.3.7 DevOps Model

This is a model where development and operations teams work together to streamline the development process and ensure that the software is deployed and maintained efficiently.

Each software development model has its own strengths and weaknesses, and the choice of model will depend on the specific project requirements and the team's preferences and expertise.

## 5.4 Model-View-Controller

MVC stands for Model-View-Controller, which is a software design pattern used to structure web applications. It separates an application's data, user interface, and control logic into three distinct components, allowing for easier development, testing, and maintenance of the application.

Here is a brief overview of each component:

### 5.4.1 Model

The model represents the data and business logic of the application. It is responsible for retrieving and storing data and providing methods for manipulating that data.

### 5.4.2 View

The view represents the user interface of the application. It displays the data to the user and provides a way for the user to interact with the application.

### 5.4.3 Controller

The controller acts as an intermediary between the model and the view. It receives input from the user through the view, processes that input using the model, and updates the view with the results.

The MVC pattern encourages the separation of concerns and promotes a modular approach to application development. It allows developers to work on each component independently, without affecting the other components. This makes it easier to modify or update specific parts of the application without affecting the entire system.
