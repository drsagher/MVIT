# LESSON 11 FULL STACK WEB DEVELOPMENT ROADMAP

## 11.1 Hypertext Markup Language

HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language. It is the standard markup language used to create web pages and other information that can be displayed in a web browser.

HTML uses a set of tags, or markup elements, to describe the structure and content of a web page. Tags are enclosed in angle brackets (&lt;>) and are used to specify the beginning and end of an element, as well as any attributes associated with that element. For example, the <h1&gt; tag is used to create a heading, and the &lt;p&gt; tag is used to create a paragraph.

HTML allows web developers to create structured documents that can be easily interpreted by web browsers. It is often used in combination with other technologies, such as CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) and JavaScript, to create more dynamic and interactive web pages.

Some common uses of HTML include creating web pages, building web forms, embedding images and videos, and creating links between pages. HTML is a foundational technology for web development, and is widely used on the internet today.
