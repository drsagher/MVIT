# LESSON 10 WEB DEVELOPERS

## 10.1 Who is a Web Developer

A web developer is a professional who specializes in building and maintaining websites and web applications. Web developers use a variety of programming languages, tools, and frameworks to create web-based software that can be accessed through a web browser.

The role of a web developer can involve tasks such as designing user interfaces, writing code, testing and debugging software, and maintaining and updating existing websites and applications. Web developers may work on the front-end or back-end of a web application, or on both sides depending on their skills and experience.

Front-end developers are responsible for creating the user-facing parts of a website or application, which includes designing and developing web pages, writing HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code, and ensuring that the website is responsive and mobile-friendly.

Back-end developers focus on the server-side of a web application, which involves managing data, writing code to handle requests and responses, and working with databases and other server-side technologies.

Full-stack developers have experience working on both the front-end and back-end of a web application and can handle a variety of tasks related to building and maintaining a web application.

Web development is a constantly evolving field, and web developers must stay up-to-date with the latest technologies and best practices to build effective and efficient web applications. They may work for companies of all sizes, from small businesses to large corporations, or as freelancers or contractors.
