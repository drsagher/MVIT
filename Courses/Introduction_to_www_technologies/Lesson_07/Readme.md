# LESSON 7 INTRODUCTION TO DATABASES

## 7.1 Database

A database is a collection of organized data that is stored and accessed electronically. It is designed to enable efficient retrieval, manipulation, and updating of data, and can be used to support a wide range of applications and business processes.

A database typically consists of one or more tables that contain related data. Each table is made up of rows (also known as records or tuples) and columns (also known as fields), which store the data itself. For example, a customer database might contain a table of customer records, with each row containing information such as the customer's name, address, and phone number.

Databases can be organized in various ways, depending on the specific needs of the application or business process.

## 7.2 Types of Databases

Some common types of databases include:

1. Relational databases, which store data in tables and use SQL to interact with the data.
2. NoSQL databases, which use non-relational data models and may not use SQL.
3. Object-oriented databases, which store data as objects and are often used for programming languages that support object-oriented programming.
4. Databases can be used in a wide range of applications, from small personal projects to large-scale enterprise systems. They are essential for many business processes, such as inventory management, customer relationship management, and accounting.

## 7.3 Structured Query Language

SQL, or Structured Query Language, is a programming language used to manage and manipulate relational databases. It allows users to create, update, and query databases, as well as define relationships between tables and enforce data integrity rules.

SQL can be used for a wide range of tasks, including inserting new data into a database, updating existing data, retrieving data based on specified criteria, and deleting data. It can also be used to create and modify database structures, such as tables, views, and indexes.

SQL is a declarative language, which means that users can specify what they want to do with the data rather than how to do it. SQL code is typically executed on a database server, which receives requests from client applications and returns results to them.

SQL is a widely used language in the field of data management, and it is supported by many popular relational database management systems, such as MySQL, Oracle, Microsoft SQL Server, and PostgreSQL. The language has a standardized syntax, which allows users to write SQL code that works across different database systems.

## 7.4 CRUD Operations

CRUD stands for Create, Read, Update, and Delete. These are the four basic operations that can be performed on data in a database.

### 7.4.1 Create

The create operation refers to the process of adding new data to a database. This could be a new record in a table, a new file in a file system, or a new object in an object-oriented programming language.

### 7.4.2 Read

The read operation, also known as the retrieve operation, refers to the process of fetching data from a database. This could be a single record, a set of records, or an entire table.

### 7.4.3 Update

The update operation refers to the process of modifying existing data in a database. This could involve changing a single field in a record or updating an entire set of records.

### 7.4.4 Delete

The delete operation refers to the process of removing data from a database. This could involve deleting a single record or an entire table.

Together, these four operations form the foundation of data manipulation in most database systems, and they are used extensively in web development, software engineering, and other fields that deal with data storage and management.

## 7.5 Data Storage Devices

Data storage devices are hardware components that are used to store and retrieve data in electronic form. They come in a variety of types and sizes, each with their own unique features and benefits. Here are some common data storage devices:

### 7.5.1 Hard Disk Drive (HDD)

A hard disk drive is a data storage device that uses spinning disks to store and retrieve data. It is typically found in desktop and laptop computers, and it can store large amounts of data at a relatively low cost.

### 7.5.2 Solid-State Drive (SSD)

A solid-state drive is a data storage device that uses flash memory to store and retrieve data. It is faster and more reliable than a hard disk drive, but it can be more expensive.

### 7.5.3 USB Flash Drive

A USB flash drive is a small, portable data storage device that connects to a computer's USB port. It is commonly used to store and transfer files between computers, and it can hold anywhere from a few gigabytes to several terabytes of data.

### 7.5.4 Memory Card

A memory card is a small, portable data storage device commonly used in digital cameras, smartphones, and other mobile devices. It uses flash memory to store and retrieve data, and it typically comes in sizes ranging from a few megabytes to several gigabytes.

### 7.5.5 Optical Disc

An optical disc is a data storage device that uses laser technology to read and write data. Examples of optical discs include CDs, DVDs, and Blu-ray discs. They are typically used for storing music, movies, software, and backup data.

### 7.5.6 Network-Attached Storage (NAS)

NAS is a type of data storage device that is connected to a computer network, allowing multiple users to access and share files. It is commonly used in home and small business environments.

### 7.5.7 Cloud Storage

Cloud storage is a type of data storage that allows users to store and access their data over the internet. It is typically provided by third-party companies, and it can be accessed from any device with an internet connection.

These are just a few examples of the types of data storage devices available. Each device has its own unique features and benefits, and the best one to use depends on the specific needs and requirements of the user.
