# LESSON 02 COMPUTER NETWORKS

## 2.1 Computer Network

A computer network is a group of interconnected devices, such as computers, servers, printers, and other hardware, that are linked together to allow for communication and resource sharing. The primary purpose of a computer network is to facilitate the exchange of data and information between devices, either within a local area network (LAN) or over a wide area network (WAN). Networks can be classified based on their size and geographic area, with LANs typically serving a small geographic area such as a home or office, and WANs spanning large geographic areas and typically connecting multiple LANs. Computer networks are essential for modern communication and enable a wide range of applications, such as email, instant messaging, file sharing, video conferencing, and online collaboration. Networks can be wired, using physical cables and connectors, or wireless, using radio waves to connect devices. Networks are typically managed by network administrators who ensure that the network is secure, reliable, and efficient. They are responsible for configuring and maintaining network hardware and software, ensuring that devices can communicate with one another, and implementing security measures to protect against unauthorized access and cyber-attacks. Overall, computer networks have become an essential part of modern life, enabling communication and collaboration between people and devices across the world.

## 2.2 Types of Computer Networks

[Types of Computer Networks in Urdu](https://youtu.be/a8CD8Snn028?si=YCvIpVG2e1sEdefg)

There are several types of computer networks, each with different characteristics and purposes. Here are some of the most common types of computer networks:

### 2.2.1 Local Area Network (LAN)

A LAN is a network that connects computers and devices in a limited geographic area, such as a home, office, or building. LANs are typically used to share resources such as printers, files, and internet connections.

### 2.2.2 Wide Area Network (WAN)

A WAN is a network that spans a larger geographic area than a LAN and connects multiple LANs together. WANs are typically used to connect geographically dispersed locations, such as branch offices or data centers.

### 2.2.3 Metropolitan Area Network (MAN)

A MAN is a network that spans a city or metropolitan area and connects multiple LANs and/or WANs. MANs are typically used by organizations that have multiple locations in a city or region.

### 2.2.4 Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN)

A WLAN is a LAN that uses wireless technology, such as Wi-Fi, to connect devices to the network. WLANs are typically used in public places such as airports, hotels, and coffee shops.

### 2.2.5 Storage Area Network (SAN)

A SAN is a network that provides access to centralized storage devices, such as hard drives or tape libraries. SANs are typically used by organizations that require high-speed access to large amounts of data.

### 2.2.6 Virtual Private Network (VPN)

A VPN is a network that provides secure access to a private network over the public internet. VPNs are typically used by remote workers to access company resources or by individuals to access content that may be restricted in their location.

### 2.2.7 Cloud Network

A cloud network is a network that uses cloud computing technology to provide on-demand access to computing resources, such as servers, storage, and applications. Cloud networks are typically used by organizations that require scalable and flexible computing resources.

## 2.3 Client Server Model

The client-server model is a common architecture used in computer networks and distributed computing systems. In this model, there are two main types of processes or applications: the client and the server.

The client is a program or application that requests data or services from the server. It sends a request to the server and waits for a response. The client can be running on a different computer than the server, and it can be a desktop application, a mobile app, or a web application.

The server, on the other hand, is a program or application that responds to client requests by providing the requested data or services. The server can be running on a different computer than the client, and it is responsible for managing and storing data and resources that are shared by multiple clients.

In this model, clients and servers communicate with each other over a network using a standardized communication protocol, such as HTTP or TCP/IP. The client sends a request to the server using the protocol, and the server responds with the requested data or services.

The client-server model has several advantages, including scalability, flexibility, and security. It allows multiple clients to access the same resources on a server, and it can be used in a wide variety of applications, from email and web browsing to database management and cloud computing.

## 2.4 Types of Servers

There are several types of servers used in the world of computing. Here are some of the most common types:

### 2.4.1 Web server

A web server is a computer that serves web pages to clients over the internet. It receives and processes HTTP requests from web browsers and responds with the appropriate HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files.

### 2.4.2 Mail server

A mail server is a computer that is responsible for sending, receiving, and storing email messages. It uses email protocols such as SMTP, POP, and IMAP to perform these tasks.

### 2.4.3 File Server

A file server is a computer that stores and manages files that are shared across a network. It provides centralized storage and allows users to access and edit files from multiple devices.

### 2.4.4 Database Server

A database server is a computer that manages databases and allows users to access and manipulate data within those databases. It provides services such as data storage, data retrieval, and data backup and recovery.

### 2.4.5 Application Server

An application server is a computer that runs and manages applications and services. It provides a platform for developers to build and deploy applications that can be accessed by users over a network.

### 2.4.6 Proxy Server

A proxy server is a computer that acts as an intermediary between clients and servers. It can be used to improve security, filter web content, and improve network performance by caching frequently accessed content.

## 2.5 Seven Layers of OSI

The OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) model is a conceptual framework used to describe the communication protocols used in computer networks. It defines a set of seven layers that describe the different stages of network communication, from the physical transmission of data to the application-level interaction between end users. The seven layers of the OSI model are:

### 2.5.1 Physical Layer

The physical layer deals with the transmission of raw bits over a communication channel. It includes the physical media (such as cables, wireless links, or fiber-optic lines) and the network hardware (such as network adapters, hubs, switches, and routers) that operate at the physical level.

### 2.5.2 Data Link Layer

The data link layer provides reliable data transfer between adjacent network nodes over a physical link, such as Ethernet or Wi-Fi. It includes protocols that govern how data packets are framed, transmitted, and received, as well as error detection and correction mechanisms.

### 2.5.3 Network Layer

The network layer deals with the routing and forwarding of data packets between different networks. It includes protocols that establish end-to-end connections and determine the best path for data transmission across multiple networks, as well as addressing and fragmentation mechanisms.

### 2.5.4 Transport Layer

The transport layer provides end-to-end communication services between applications running on different hosts. It includes protocols such as TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) and UDP (User Datagram Protocol) that ensure reliable and efficient data transfer, as well as flow control and congestion avoidance mechanisms.

### 2.5.5 Session Layer

The session layer establishes, manages, and terminates communication sessions between applications. It includes protocols that synchronize the exchange of data between applications and provide services such as authentication, encryption, and access control.

### 2.5.6 Presentation Layer

The presentation layer deals with the formatting and representation of data, ensuring that data sent by one application can be understood by another. It includes protocols that define data formats, encryption methods, and data compression techniques.

### 2.5.7 Application Layer

The application layer provides high-level services to end users, such as email, file transfer, and web browsing. It includes protocols that enable application programs to access network services, and provides interfaces for users to interact with network applications.
