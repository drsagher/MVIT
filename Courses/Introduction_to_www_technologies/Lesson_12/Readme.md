# LESSON 12 INTRODUCTION TO OPERATING SYSTEMS

## 12.1 Operating System (OS)

An operating system (OS) is a collection of software that manages and controls the resources and services of a computer system. It is the most fundamental type of software that runs on a computer and provides a platform for other software to run on.

The main purpose of an operating system is to provide a consistent and reliable environment for running applications and managing hardware resources such as the CPU, memory, storage, and input/output devices. The OS manages the resources of the computer system and allocates them to various processes and applications running on the system.
