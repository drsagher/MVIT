# LESSON 8 APPLICATION PROGRAMMING INTERFACE

## 8.1 Web Components

Web Components are a set of web platform APIs that allow you to create new custom, reusable, encapsulated HTML tags to use in web pages and web applications. They provide a way to create reusable components for the web, much like how classes and functions are used in traditional programming.

Web Components consist of three key technologies:

### 8.1.1 Custom Elements

This allows developers to define their own HTML elements and specify their behavior using JavaScript.

### 8.1.2 Shadow DOM

This allows developers to encapsulate the styles and markup of a component, so that it doesn't clash with the rest of the document.

### 8.1.3 HTML Templates

This allows developers to define templates that can be used to create new instances of a component.

Using these technologies, web developers can create encapsulated, reusable components that can be easily shared and used across multiple projects. This makes it easier to build complex web applications that are both scalable and maintainable. Web Components are supported by most modern browsers, and there are several frameworks and libraries that provide additional tools and utilities to make it easier to work with them.

## 8.2 Application Programming Interface

API stands for Application Programming Interface. It is a set of protocols, standards, and tools that are used to build software applications and enable communication between different software components.

In simple terms, an API acts as a bridge between different applications, allowing them to exchange data and interact with each other. For example, a mobile application might use an API to retrieve information from a database, or a web application might use an API to integrate with a third-party service.

APIs can be used for a wide range of purposes, such as:

### 8.2.1 Retrieving Data

An API can be used to retrieve data from a database, file, or external service.

### 8.2.2 Updating Data

An API can be used to update data in a database or external service.

### 8.2.3 Sending Notifications

An API can be used to send notifications to other applications or services.

### 8.2.4 Authenticating Users

An API can be used to authenticate users and manage access to data or resources.

## 8.3 APIs Design Technologies

APIs can be designed and implemented in many different ways, using different technologies and protocols. Some common types of APIs include REST APIs, SOAP APIs, and GraphQL APIs. Each type of API has its own strengths and weaknesses, and the choice of which to use will depend on the specific needs of the application.
