# MVC-13 Database Management Systems
data efficiently and securely. A DBMS acts as an intermediary between users and databases, providing a structured way to organize data into tables, schemas, or other formats depending on the model (e.g., relational, hierarchical, network, object-oriented, or NoSQL). Relational Database Management Systems (RDBMS), such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, and Microsoft SQL Server, use SQL (Structured Query Language) for querying and managing data, offering features like ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) compliance to ensure data integrity. Modern DBMS also support scalability, indexing for faster queries, transaction management, and robust security measures like encryption and access control. Beyond traditional RDBMS, NoSQL systems like MongoDB and Cassandra cater to unstructured or semi-structured data, enabling flexibility for big data and real-time applications. Key functions of DBMS include data modeling, backup and recovery, concurrency control, and performance optimization. By centralizing data storage and providing tools for efficient data manipulation, DBMS plays a critical role in industries ranging from finance and healthcare to e-commerce and analytics, ensuring data consistency, reliability, and accessibility while supporting decision-making through advanced querying and reporting capabilities.
