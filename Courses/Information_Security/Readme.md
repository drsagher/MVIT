# Information Security
## Lesson 01 Introduction to Information Security
Information Security is a critical discipline in today’s interconnected digital landscape, where protecting data, systems, and networks from evolving threats is paramount. This course provides a foundational understanding of the principles, practices, and technologies essential to safeguarding information assets. Beginning with the CIA Triad—Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability—students will explore how these core objectives underpin every aspect of secure system design and risk management. The curriculum delves into common threats such as cyberattacks (e.g., malware, phishing), human vulnerabilities, and environmental risks, while emphasizing proactive strategies like encryption, access controls, and disaster recovery planning. Through real-world case studies and hands-on exercises, learners will analyze security frameworks (e.g., ISO 27001, NIST), compliance requirements (GDPR, HIPAA), and ethical considerations in data protection. The course also addresses emerging trends, including cloud security, IoT vulnerabilities, and AI-driven threats, preparing participants to adapt to a rapidly changing threat landscape. By blending theoretical concepts with practical applications, this course equips students with the skills to assess risks, implement safeguards, and foster a security-aware culture within organizations. Whether pursuing a career in cybersecurity or enhancing organizational resilience, this introduction serves as a gateway to mastering the tools and mindset needed to defend against modern digital challenges.

## What is Information Security?
Information Security (InfoSec) is the practice of protecting information and information systems from unauthorized access, use, disclosure, disruption, modification, or destruction. It ensures the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of data, whether digital or physical, and is critical for safeguarding sensitive information in personal, corporate, and governmental contexts.
