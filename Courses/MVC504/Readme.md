# MVC-504 Full Stack Development with Laravel
The course *Full Stack Development with Laravel* is a comprehensive guide to building modern, scalable, and efficient web applications using the Laravel PHP framework. It begins with an introduction to Laravel's elegant syntax and powerful features, such as **Eloquent ORM** for database interactions, **Blade templating engine** for views, and **Artisan CLI** for automating tasks. Participants learn to design and implement RESTful APIs, covering essential concepts like routing, middleware, request handling, and validation. The course emphasizes **MySQL** or **PostgreSQL** integration for data storage, including schema design, migrations, and query optimization. It also explores **authentication and authorization** using Laravel's built-in tools like Passport or Sanctum for API security. On the frontend, the course integrates **Vue.js** or **React** to build dynamic, interactive user interfaces, with a focus on components, state management, and API consumption using Axios or Fetch. The tech stack includes **Laravel**, **PHP**, **MySQL/PostgreSQL**, **Vue.js/React**, **JavaScript/TypeScript**, and tools like **Postman** for API testing. Advanced topics like **caching with Redis**, **queue management** with Laravel Horizon, **event broadcasting** with WebSockets, and **deployment** using Docker and cloud platforms (e.g., AWS, DigitalOcean) are also covered. By the end of the course, developers will have built a fully functional full-stack application, gaining hands-on experience in Laravel development and best practices for building and deploying modern web applications.
