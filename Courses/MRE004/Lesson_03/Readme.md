# Lesson 3 Working with Arrays in NumPy

is foundational to data manipulation and numerical computing in Python. NumPy, short for Numerical Python, provides a powerful `ndarray` object that allows efficient storage and operations on large datasets. Arrays in NumPy are homogeneous, meaning all elements must be of the same data type, which enables faster computations compared to standard Python lists. Understanding array attributes such as `.shape`, `.dtype`, `.ndim`, and `.size` helps in inspecting and managing array structure effectively. Accessing and slicing arrays—whether one-dimensional or multi-dimensional—is done using intuitive indexing syntax similar to Python lists but extended for multiple dimensions, allowing users to extract specific rows, columns, or sub-arrays with ease. Handling missing data is another crucial aspect when working with real-world datasets, and NumPy supports this through special values like `np.nan` (Not a Number). Functions such as `np.isnan()` help detect missing values, while others like `np.nanmean()` or `np.nansum()` allow for safe computations by ignoring NaNs. Together, these features make NumPy an essential tool for scientific computing, data analysis, and machine learning workflows.
