# Lesson 6 Array Operations and NumPy Functions

Array Operations and NumPy Functions form the backbone of numerical computing in Python, enabling efficient and intuitive manipulation of large datasets. NumPy provides a wide range of built-in functions that allow element-wise operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division across entire arrays, eliminating the need for cumbersome loops. These operations are performed in optimized C-based code under the hood, making them significantly faster and more memory-efficient than equivalent operations in native Python. In addition to basic arithmetic, NumPy offers a comprehensive suite of mathematical and statistical functions—including `np.sum()`, `np.mean()`, `np.std()`, `np.min()`, and `np.max()`—that operate on arrays to compute aggregate results along specified axes. Advanced operations like broadcasting enable arrays of different shapes to interact in computations, expanding dimensions automatically to make shapes compatible. Other essential functions such as `np.reshape()`, `np.concatenate()`, `np.split()`, and `np.transpose()` provide powerful tools for array manipulation, transformation, and restructuring. With these capabilities, NumPy simplifies complex numerical tasks, making it an indispensable library for scientific computing, data analysis, and machine learning.
