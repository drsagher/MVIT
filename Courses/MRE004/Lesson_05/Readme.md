# Lesson 5 Handling Missing Data

**Handling Missing Data using NumPy** is a critical skill when working with real-world datasets, where incomplete or missing values are common. In NumPy, missing data is typically represented using the special floating-point value `NaN` (Not a Number), which acts as a placeholder for undefined or unrepresentable values. This allows arrays to maintain their structure and dimensionality even when some entries are unknown or unavailable. NumPy provides several tools to detect, filter, and manage missing values efficiently. For instance, the function `np.isnan()` can be used to identify positions of missing values within an array, returning a boolean mask that highlights where data is absent. Users can then use this mask to either remove missing values or replace them with appropriate substitutes such as the mean, median, or a constant value using functions like `np.nanmean()` or `np.where()`. Additionally, NumPy offers versions of common mathematical operations—such as `np.nanmean()`, `np.nanstd()`, and `np.nansum()`—that automatically skip over `NaN` values during computation, ensuring accurate results without requiring prior data cleaning. While NumPy does not support as extensive missing data handling capabilities as Pandas, its foundational tools provide a robust starting point for preprocessing numerical arrays before further analysis or modeling. Properly addressing missing data is essential for maintaining data integrity and avoiding skewed or incorrect conclusions in scientific computing and data science workflows.
