# Lesson 01 Understanding CSS Animation Basics
Understanding CSS Animation Basics is the foundation for creating dynamic and interactive web experiences. At its core, CSS animation allows developers to transition elements between styles or create complex motion sequences using keyframes. The process begins with grasping essential properties like transition, which enables smooth changes in element states (e.g., hover effects), and @keyframes, which defines the stages of an animationâ€™s behavior over time. By learning how to manipulate properties such as opacity, transform, and position, developers can bring static designs to life. Additionally, understanding timing functions, delays, and iteration counts helps control the speed and flow of animations, ensuring they feel natural and intentional. With these basics in hand, developers can start experimenting with simple animations, paving the way for more advanced techniques and creative possibilities.
