# Lesson 2 An Introduction to TensorFlow

[TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) is an open-source, versatile deep learning framework developed by Google, designed to facilitate the development, training, and deployment of machine learning models, particularly neural networks, across a wide range of platforms and applications. Initially released in 2015, TensorFlow provides a comprehensive ecosystem for building models using high-level APIs like [**Keras**](https://keras.io/) for rapid prototyping, as well as low-level APIs for fine-grained control over neural network operations. It supports a variety of architectures, including Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs), Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), and Transformers, making it suitable for tasks like image classification, natural language processing, and time-series analysis. TensorFlowâ€™s core is built around **tensors** (multi-dimensional arrays) and a **computation graph** that enables efficient execution of mathematical operations, optimized for parallel processing on GPUs and TPUs. It supports **automatic differentiation** for backpropagation, enabling gradient-based optimization techniques like Adam or Stochastic Gradient Descent. TensorFlow also offers **TensorFlow Extended (TFX)** for end-to-end MLOps pipelines, **TensorFlow Lite** for mobile and edge device deployment, and **TensorFlow Serving** for production-grade model serving. With robust support for distributed training via tools like [**Horovod**](https://horovod.ai/), cross-platform compatibility (Windows, macOS, Linux, and cloud platforms like AWS, GCP), and integration with libraries like [**NumPy**](https://numpy.org/) and [**Pandas**](https://pandas.pydata.org/), TensorFlow is widely used in academia and industry. Its active community, extensive documentation, and pre-trained models (e.g., via TensorFlow Hub) make it accessible to beginners while providing the scalability needed for enterprise-level applications.
