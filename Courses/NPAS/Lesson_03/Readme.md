# Lesson 03 Transmission Modes and Protocol Design Issues in Computer Networks
Transmission Modes and Protocol Design Issues in Computer Networks are crucial aspects of computer networking that ensure efficient and reliable data communication. Transmission modes, including asynchronous and synchronous transmission, determine how data is transmitted over a network, with each mode having its own advantages and disadvantages. Asynchronous transmission, for instance, is simpler and less expensive to implement, but may be less efficient and more prone to errors. On the other hand, synchronous transmission is more efficient and less prone to errors, but is more complex and expensive to implement. Protocol design issues, such as performance, reliability, security, and scalability, must also be carefully considered to ensure that data is transmitted accurately and efficiently over the network. By understanding transmission modes and protocol design issues, network designers and administrators can create efficient, reliable, and secure computer networks that meet the needs of users.
