# Lesson 02 Noise, Media, Encoding in Transmission

## 1. Noise
Noise refers to unwanted disturbances that interfere with signal transmission, causing errors or degradation in communication systems. It affects both analog and digital transmissions but in different ways.

### Noise in Analog Transmission:
In analog systems, noise directly distorts the signal since the signal is continuous.
Common types of noise include thermal noise, intermodulation noise, and crosstalk.
Once noise enters an analog signal, it is difficult to remove completely, leading to poor signal quality in audio, video, or radio transmissions.

### Noise in Digital Transmission:
Digital signals use discrete values (0s and 1s), making them more resistant to noise than analog signals.
Noise in digital transmission can cause bit errors, leading to incorrect data reception.
Error detection and correction techniques (such as parity checks and forward error correction) help minimize noise effects.

### Effects of Noise on Data Transmission
1. Noise can reduce the data rate, making it slower to transmit data.
2. Noise can increase the error rate, requiring more retransmissions and reducing overall efficiency.
3. Noise can decrease signal quality, making it more difficult to accurately transmit data.
4. Noise can increase latency, making it take longer to transmit data.

### Noise Reduction Techniques
1. Using error-correcting codes, such as Reed-Solomon or Hamming codes, to detect and correct errors.
2. Amplifying the signal to increase its strength and reduce the impact of noise.
3. Using filters to remove noise from the signal.
4. Using modulation techniques, such as QAM or PSK, to reduce the impact of noise.
5. Using diversity techniques, such as spatial diversity or frequency diversity, to reduce the impact of noise.

## 2. Transmission Media

Transmission media refers to the physical pathways or channels through which data, voice, or video signals are transmitted from one device to another.

### Types of Transmission Media

#### Wired Media: Uses physical cables to transmit data.
- Twisted Pair Cable
- Coaxial Cable
- Fiber Optic Cable

#### Wireless Media: Uses radio waves or infrared signals to transmit data.
- Radio Waves
- Microwaves
- Infrared Waves

### Characteristics of Transmission Media

1. Bandwidth: The range of frequencies that a transmission medium can support.
2. Data Rate: The amount of data that can be transmitted per unit time.
3. Distance: The maximum distance over which a signal can be transmitted without degradation.
4. Interference: The susceptibility of a transmission medium to electromagnetic interference.
5. Security: The level of protection provided by a transmission medium against unauthorized access.

### Advantages and Disadvantages of Transmission Media

#### Wired Media:

- Advantages: High bandwidth, low interference, high security.
- Disadvantages: Limited mobility, high installation cost.

#### Wireless Media:
- Advantages: High mobility, low installation cost, easy deployment.
- Disadvantages: Low bandwidth, high interference, low security.

### Applications of Transmission Media

1. Local Area Networks (LANs): Wired media (twisted pair, coaxial) and wireless media (Wi-Fi).
2. Wide Area Networks (WANs): Wired media (fiber optic, coaxial) and wireless media (microwaves, satellites).
3. Internet: Wired media (fiber optic, coaxial) and wireless media (Wi-Fi, cellular networks).
