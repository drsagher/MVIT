# M300 Mathematical Concepts for Programming and AI Engineering
The course "Mathematical Foundations of Full Stack Development and AI Engineering" covers the essential mathematical concepts required for full stack development and AI engineering. The course is divided into four modules: Discrete Mathematics for Programming, Linear Algebra for Machine Learning, Calculus for Optimization, and Probability and Statistics for Data Science. In the first module, students learn about set theory, relations, functions, graph theory, propositional and predicate logic, and mathematical induction and recursion. The second module focuses on linear algebra, covering vector spaces, linear transformations, matrix algebra, eigenvalues, eigenvectors, and singular value decomposition, with applications to machine learning and data analysis. The third module introduces calculus, including differential calculus, integral calculus, and optimization techniques, with applications to machine learning. The final module covers probability and statistics, including probability theory, statistics, and applications to data science and machine learning. By the end of the course, students will have a solid understanding of the mathematical foundations of full stack development and AI engineering, and will be able to apply mathematical concepts to solve problems in these fields.
