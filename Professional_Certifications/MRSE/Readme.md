# Mansha Robotics and Software Engineer (MRSE) Certification
The Mansha Robotics and Software Engineer (MRSE) Certification, offered by MVIT, is a cutting-edge 24-month program designed to equip learners with mastery in fullstack development and Agentic AI application development. This comprehensive certification bridges the gap between traditional software engineering and next-gen AI-driven robotics, empowering participants to build scalable web applications and autonomous AI systems from scratch. Over two years, students dive into modern frameworks (React, Node.js, Django), cloud deployment (AWS, Docker), and robotics integration, while specializing in Agentic AIâ€”training models to act autonomously in dynamic environments. The curriculum includes hands-on projects like developing AI chatbots, robotic process automation (RPA) tools, and ethical AI systems, with a focus on real-world use cases in healthcare, logistics, and smart manufacturing. MVITâ€™s industry-aligned approach ensures graduates emerge as T-shaped professionals, fluent in both coding and AI ethics, ready to lead innovation in the era of self-operating machines. Ideal for aspiring developers seeking to future-proof their careers, MRSE blends rigorous theory with hackathons, mentorship from robotics experts, and collaboration on MVITâ€™s proprietary AI simulation platforms. By graduation, learners earn not just a certification but a portfolio of deployable Agentic AI solutionsâ€”from self-debugging codebases to AI-driven robotic armsâ€”making them indispensable in the $1.3 trillion AI robotics revolution. ðŸš€ No CS degree? No problem: MRSEâ€™s project-first pedagogy ensures even beginners code like seniors by Month 6.
