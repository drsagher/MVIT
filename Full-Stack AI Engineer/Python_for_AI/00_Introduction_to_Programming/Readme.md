## Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

### Definition
Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that revolves around the concept of objects and classes. It's based on the idea of organizing and structuring software design around data, or objects, rather than functions and logic.

### Key Concepts
-	Classes: A class is a blueprint or template that defines the properties and behavior of an object.
-	Objects: An object is an instance of a class, and has its own set of attributes (data) and methods (functions).
-	Inheritance: Inheritance is the mechanism by which one class can inherit the properties and behavior of another class.
-	Polymorphism: Polymorphism is the ability of an object to take on multiple forms, depending on the context in which it's used.
-	Encapsulation: Encapsulation is the concept of bundling data and methods that operate on that data within a single unit, making it harder for other parts of the program to access or modify the data directly.
-	Abstraction: Abstraction is the concept of showing only the necessary information to the outside world while hiding the internal details.

### Principles
-	Single Responsibility Principle (SRP): A class should have only one reason to change.
-	Open-Closed Principle (OCP): A class should be open for extension but closed for modification.
-	Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP): Subtypes should be substitutable for their base types.
-	Interface Segregation Principle (ISP): A client should not be forced to depend on interfaces it does not use.
-	Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP): High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules, but both should depend on abstractions.
