# 03 Variables and Data Structures
In Python, variables are used to store and manipulate data. A variable is a name given to a value, and it can be reassigned to hold different values. Python has various data structures that allow you to store and organize data in different ways. The basic data structures in Python include lists, tuples, dictionaries, and sets. Lists are ordered collections of values that can be of any data type, including strings, integers, and other lists. Tuples are similar to lists but are immutable, meaning their values cannot be changed after creation. Dictionaries are unordered collections of key-value pairs, where each key is unique and maps to a specific value. Sets are unordered collections of unique values, often used for membership testing and mathematical operations. Understanding variables and data structures is essential in Python programming, as they form the foundation of data manipulation and analysis. By mastering these concepts, you can write efficient and effective Python code to solve real-world problems.
