## Type Hints
Type hints are a feature in Python that allows developers to specify the expected data types of function parameters, return types, and variables. Introduced in Python 3.5, type hints provide a way to add type annotations to code, making it easier to understand, maintain, and debug. Type hints are not enforced at runtime, but rather serve as documentation and can be used by third-party tools such as type checkers, IDEs, and linters to provide additional features like code completion, error detection, and code optimization. By using type hints, developers can improve the readability and maintainability of their code, reduce errors, and make it easier for others to understand their codebase. For example, a function with type hints might look like def greeting(name: str) -> str:, indicating that the function takes a string parameter and returns a string value.
